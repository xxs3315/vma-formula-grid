# 基础表格

## 基本用法

<vma-formula-grid
    :data="data" 
    :size="size" 
    :type="themeType" 
    style="width: 100%; height: 800px;"
/>

::: code-group
```vue
    <vma-formula-grid 
        :data="data" 
        :size="size" 
        :type="themeType"
        style="width: 100%; height: 800px;"
/>
```
